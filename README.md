# Healthcare-System-Analysis

There is growing demand on healthcare institutions to provide better care and improve patient outcomes. While this provides a problem, it also gives companies a chance to significantly raise the standard of care by utilizing additional data value and insights. The term "health care system analysis" describes the process of analyzing data to find trends and patterns in the collected data using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The length of a patient's stay is a crucial factor, even if healthcare management uses a variety of measures to evaluate success.

Hospitals can optimize their treatment plans to lower length of stay (LOS) and lower infection rates among patients, staff, and visitors by using predictive analytics to forecast LOS.

# Methodology

Hospital admission data was analyzed to accurately predict the patient’s Length of Stay at the time of admit so that the hospitals can optimize resources and function better. Built 3 models in Python to predict the length of stay,

A supervised algorithm Naïve Bayes which was classifying with an accuracy of 34.55%.

An ensemble method XGBoost which was predicting with an accuracy of 43.05%.

A dense neural network with 6 layers which yields an accuracy of 42.5%.
